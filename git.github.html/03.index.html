    <h2>Git Ignore---</h2>
    <p>
      A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which file and folders to
      ignore.It is usually placed in the root directory of a project.When Git
      sees a .gitignore file, it will ignore any files or folders that are
      listed in the file. <br /><br />The .gitignore files are important in
      version control because they help to keep the repository clean and
      organized.They also prevent developers from accidentally committing
      unnecessary files to the repository, such as log files, build artifacts,
      and IDE configuration files. <br /><br />Here are some examples of files
      and folders that you might want to ignore in a Git repository: - personal
      secret keys or files, log files, 3uilt artifacts, IDE config files, and
      temporary files.
