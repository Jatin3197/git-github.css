         <li>Enhances the project development speed by providing efficient collaboration</li>
         <li>Reduce possibilities of errors and conflicts meanwhile project development through traceability to every small change,

         </li>
         <li>Employees or contributors of the project can contribute from anywhere irrespective of the different geographical locations through this VCS,
